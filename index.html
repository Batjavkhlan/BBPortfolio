  <h3>My story</h3>
  <p>Travel guide, Hotel translator, Waiter, Bartender, IP camera installer,
  Salesman, Sales manager, Road labor, Supervisor of road construction unit, 
  Consulting team staff, Consulting team coordinator, IT staff, IT specialist...
  </p>
  <p> These are my worked fields during my pursuit of myself in last decade. 
  I wasn't jumping from one-to-one, I was challenging from another to another, bottom to top. 
  It was long,joyful and well experienced journey.
  </p>
  <p> But you know what, nothing beat my little happiness which I got from my first code written in C 
  which displays 'Hello world' in first year of Software Engineer bachelor.This happiness always followed me and tells me 
  “with coding you can help more people, communities, businesses”.
  </p>
  <p> I never feel sorry for dropping of university, it was my duty and responsibility 
  in front of my family to earn money as much as I can. I guess I did well and I learned discipline, hard-working and dedication.
  Also one thing that I saw in every position that man who loves what he does always succeed.
  </p>
  <p> Now I am ready to dedicate myself fully for my happiness, joy and meaning of my life. 
  I don't lie I am the man who feel happiness when struggling to solve the problem in a bunch of codes.
  </p>
  <p>Please support me to be one of your bests.
  </p>
  <p>Beside coding, I interested in chess, poker, CSGO and hiking.
