  <h3>My story</h3>
  <p>Travel guide, Hotel translator, Waiter, bartender, IP camera installer,
  salesman, sales manager, road labor, supervisor of road construction unit, 
  consulting team staff, consulting team coordinator, IT staff, IT specialist...
  these are my worked fields during my pursuit of my self in last decade. 
  I wasn't jumping from one-to-one, I was challenging from another to another. 
  It was long and joyful, well experienced journey however nothing beat my 
  little happiness which I got from small code I wrote in C 
  which displays 'Hello world' in first year of Software Engineer bachelor.</p>
  <p>I never feel sorry for dropping of university, 
  it was my duty and responsibility in front of my family to earn money as much as I can.
  I guess did well and I learned discipline, hard-working and dedication.
  Also one thing that I saw in every position that man who loves what he does always succeed.</p>
  <p>Now I am ready to dedicate myself fully for my happiness, joy and meaning of my life. 
  I don't lie I am the man who feel happiness when struggling to solve the problem in a bunch of codes. </p>
  <p>Please support me to be one of your bests.</p>
  <p>Beside coding, I interested in chess, poker, CSGO and hiking.</p>
